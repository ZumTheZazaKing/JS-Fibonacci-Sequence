# JS-Fibonacci-Sequence
the fibonacci sequence I coded in JavaScript

this one was a doozy to handle with

but it's still pretty great that I managed to do it

oh, and I turned a bug into a feature for this one

but I won't tell what the bug was

for this project, all you have to do is press the button and you'll add terms into the fibonacci sequence

you can do it infitnitely, so why don't you try see how high the computer can handle?

anyways,

you can edit the code and request a pull from me
